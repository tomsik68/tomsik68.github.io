I've always liked making games and I still do. In my opinion, making games is the most creative way of programming, because you connect drawing, recording music & programming. That's why it's so fun, but I still think that the programming part is the best one ;) <br>
Edit: Uploading my old games is finished, you can find everything in "Old Software" section in the main menu.

Nowadays, I enjoy doing [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) competitions(mainly the August ones).

Yes, I'll upload something I'm working on. This page is just a hobby thingy, so be patient if you want to see more :)

Currently I'm working on few secret game projects with my buddy @dudoslav. His page totally reveals more than mine, so you should go check it out - http://dudoslav.github.io/ :)
