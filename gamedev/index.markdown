I've always liked making games and I still do. In my opinion, making games is the most creative way of programming, because you connect drawing, recording music & programming. That's why it's so fun, but I still think that the programming part is the best one ;) <br>
I'd love to upload some of my older games on this page, but I need to get time first.

Nowadays, I enjoy doing [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) competitions(mainly the August ones).
