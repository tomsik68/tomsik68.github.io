I've always liked making games and I still do. In my opinion, making games is the most creative way of programming, because you connect drawing, recording music & programming. That's why it's so fun, but I still think that the programming part is the best one ;) <br>
Edit: Uploading my games still in progress, you can find them in Old Software section...

Nowadays, I enjoy doing [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) competitions(mainly the August ones).

Currently I'm working on few secret game projects with my buddy @dudoslav. His page totally reveals more than mine, so you should go check it out - http://dudoslav.github.io/ :)
