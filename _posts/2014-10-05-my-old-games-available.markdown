Hello, so I've kind of promised to add my old games & software on this site. 
Today, this has come true. You can see "Old Software" section along with others. I'm not very proud of it, but still... 
I think people should see software from my "younger" times :). Everyone needs to start somewhere and I've just published what I consider my starting point in programming.
So, if you've got enough courage, you can visit the Old Software section and read on. There are some interesting things :)
