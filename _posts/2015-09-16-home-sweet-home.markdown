Hello World! I'm Tomsik68. Here's a link to my github account: [Github/@tomsik68](https://github.com/tomsik68)

This is my homepage, which I created from scratch using Aptana Studio 3. 
Here, you can find my projects categorised and described and this is also the best place to get updates about my projects.

If I ever create any webgames/webapps, you'll find them all hosted here. 
This page is also a new central website for my blog, because I want to have more control over the page and want to use it for projects aswell.

Let me just briefly describe what's under these sections:

* Home - This post
* Blog - blog.
* Gamedev Area - About me & game development, some games might appear there
* Minecraft Area - Minecraft-related content(plugins, mods)
* Other projects - Messy list of programs I'm too lazy to create section for.
* Old Software - I started programming when I was roughly 11. In this section, you can find list of many failed projects I made when I was younger.
* About Me - Various information about me you may find interesting plus ways to contact me on different social platforms

I had the feeling that saying this page is new even though it's 1 year old is kinda weird so I updated the post :)
