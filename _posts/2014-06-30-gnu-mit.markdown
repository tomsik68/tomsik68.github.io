Hello everybody reading this!

I had some additional time, which allowed me to improve quality of my projects. 
Today, I'd like to announce, that I'm going to change from GNU/GPLv3 to MIT. Why?
I spent some time reading about various open-source licenses and found, that MIT is much better for others than GPL, as GPL contains too many restrictions.
MIT is more permissive, so I believe this change will attract more users & developers to my projects :)

This change will affect in fact everything I maintain, develop or create. I can't really change licenses all day long, so it will happen during summer holidays.
Thank you everyone for following & supporting me! :)
