Hello World! This is my new homepage, which I created from scratch using Aptana Studio 3. 
Here, you can find my projects categorised and described and this is also the best place to get updates about my projects.

If I ever create any webgames/webapps, you'll find them all hosted here. This page is also a new central website for my blog, because I want to have more control over the page and want to use it for projects aswell.


Let me just briefly describe what's under these sections:

* Home - Latest posts
* Gamedev - Games I created
* Minecraft - Minecraft-related content(plugins, mods)
* Other projects - Mostly software that doesn't fit to any category
* About Me - Various information about me you may find interesting plus ways to contact me on different social platforms
