Hello everyone, after making hard decisions, I've decided to mark HelpPlus as inactive, because it is completely replaced by bukkit's help system. 
Bukkit's help system detects all commands along with permission, plugin, description and allows you to write your own topics. 
Main purpose of HelpPlus was to detect all commands, which is what Bukkit's help system now does, so HelpPlus is not necessary anymore.
I won't continue to provide support for HelpPlus and no more updates will be available. 

Thank you for supporting this project, if there are any plugin developers who wish to take over, just toss me a PM on BukkitDev (my profile is on "About Me" page) :)
