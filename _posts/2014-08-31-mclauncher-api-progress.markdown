Hello, so I'd like to give you a little progress update regarding MCLauncherAPI.

Today, I've released version 0.2.1, which is quickfix version where I fixed running minecraft on windows. 
I'm sure there are many similar problems, because my primary system is linux and I don't have a single windows PC to test on. If anyone has this "rare" operating system installed on their machines, I'd like you to help me with testing process. 
You can play around with files in test directory. There are 2 things that need to be tested in depth: library installation(TestMCDownloadInstall) and minecraft launching(TestMCDownloadLaunch). 
Both of these are a lot platform-dependent and I'm sad that I can't test them as carefully as I'd like to. That's why I'm asking you for help.

Thanks everybody for reading and see you another time :)
