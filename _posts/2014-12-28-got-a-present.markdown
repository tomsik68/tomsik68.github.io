Merry Christmas everyone!
Today I've got awesome news for you! 
The news is about my plugin I've announced some time ago which is supposed to replace my popular plugin Chimneys SMP.
I'm speaking about ParticleWorkshop. 
On Christmas, I've created a project page for it on BukkitDev and I'm now actively working on it during holidays.

However, things are not going so well, so the development is still pretty slow compared to how fast I've made chimneys.
It's because I'm thinking more about the program architecture, so I won't have to rewrite it ever again. 

Anyways, that's my present for you: ParticleWorkshop is now in alpha stage, you can grab its JAR file on DevBukkit page(hear the rhyme :P ).

Last, but not least, I'd like to say a word about this blog. Some of you may know, that I used Google Blogger service for some time in the past.
In my opinion, this github page is great place for my blog, because people can find it on my github account, I can also add other content than blog posts and I can customize it really easily once I'll want to change the design by hand... 
There's no possibility to add comments, but I don't think there are so many active readers on this blog to migrate to different service just because of comment system :D 
I probably won't write anything here till next year, so in case you're reading this on January 1st (of any year, even in the future!),
I wish happy new year to you! :)
