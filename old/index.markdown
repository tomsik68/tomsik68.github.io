Whoever is reading this, please note, that:

* I've created quite a lot of things, so it's pretty difficult to split it up in categories.
* This software wasn't meant to be published, so please don't blame me for code un-clearance
* I own most of this software. I might've used stack overflow or something, but I wrote most of the code you're seeing
* I don't own any art distributed in .tar.gz files.

I'll try to list it chronologically from the worst up to the best ones :)

# "Testing" java apps

These were probably first I've made(with help of my father who used to work in java).


## Jarkanoid

It was probably supposed to be an arkanoid clone.

## Roll the dice?

I don't really remember what this is about, but it was in a folder roll the dice, so it probably has something to do with that :D

# Nintendo DS games

## MO (Mario Online?)

I remember I really liked Mario Online(unofficial mario game where you just kill bad guys). I wanted to re-create it for NDS, so I tried and this actually turned up pretty nice!

## MPC(my programmable car?)

This should've been a simple programmable car where you tell the car how to pass through a level.
Nothing difficult, except I failed to finish it. Again :D

## MIJO (???)

I attempted to create a platformer game. You may only guess what the result was :D

## mcs_pinger

Pinging minecraft servers on Nintendo DS.

## netchecker

Internet connectivity cheking.

## Winfo

Information about wireless networks
DL: [http://tomsik68.github.io/old/files/tomsik68_Winfo.tar.gz]

## wiHack

With winfo, wiHack must've arrived... I didn't know to work with char arrays in C, so it never worked. It's a nice example of why C is difficult: so that small kids can't hack your wifi :D
DL: [http://tomsik68.github.io/old/files/tomsik68_wiHack.tar.gz]

# Visual Basic programs?

I know I don't like Microsoft nowadays, but when I was younger, I used Windows XP and Visual Basic. It was really different from C and Java, so I was really confused by it :D

## StarCraft patcher

This program was used to apply Blizzard no-cd patch for StarCraft 1.

## BinDecompiler

Legends say I learned to work with binary files before text files. Those legends are true. I was able to work with binary files before I learned to work with text files. Isn't it odd?
DL: [http://tomsik68.github.io/old/files/tomsik68_BinDecompiler.tar.gz]

## JaskovCommander

Attempt to re-create free commander 
DL: [http://tomsik68.github.io/old/files/tomsik68_jaskovcommander.tar.gz]

## PasswordHacker

I was really a badass when I was small. I attempted to create a program to force-bypass password in a form. Really odd, unfinished and stuff.

## Bukkit Plugin Kit

I can't believe this list is so long! But this is the last application on the list, because it's the first application I've ever published.
BukkitPluginKit is living its own life on bukkit forums, as it's no longer needed.
From now on, I'm creating plugins for bukkit and doing mostly java(you can see my projects on github).
