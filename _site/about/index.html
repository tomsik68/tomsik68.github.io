	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p class="meta">17 May 2014</p>
<p>Hello World! My name is Tomsik68. I&#39;m 17 year-old boy who is interested in video games, programming, sci-fi and stuff.
My IRL name is Tomas and I live in Slovakia. There&#39;s really nothing to say about my personal life, because there&#39;s none :)</p>

<p>Most of my time is spent by playing MineCraft, either vanilla or few modpacks from technic launcher. I prefer multiplayer, but I play singleplayer most of time, since my friends don&#39;t play MC so much. Next game I play really often is Spelunky, which I only play on XBOX.
<em>Sometimes</em> I play some LoL (I&#39;m on both EUNE and EUW, summoner name: &quot;jaskuu&quot;). I don&#39;t play it very often, because it gets boring over time &amp; it needs to patch very often.</p>

<p>My next gaming passions are old-school games. Not so much old-school, but today it&#39;s old-school already. I&#39;m talking about several older free titles like Happy Land Adventures, which I played a lot as child, Icy tower, Chicken Invaders 1. I also love these old legendary strategies - Age of Empires 2 and StarCraft 1.
Last but not least, I like some DOS games. These are really funny and I could spend whole days playing these. I&#39;m talking about Hocus Pocus(which I completed), Crystal Caves 1,2 and 3, Prehistorik 1,2, Dangerous Dave, Tunneler and Prince of Persia.<BR>
I also mentioned I like programming, so here it goes... My favourite programming languages are Java &amp; Python, but I also know VB.NET, C# and I&#39;m learning Pascal at school. You can find some of my projects open-sourced on github(link is below in contact section) and also this page. I started programming when I was 11 or 12. It was because I didn&#39;t get to programming earlier and at that time, I purchased MineCraft.
I needed a &#39;creative&#39; mode which wasn&#39;t available at that time, so I programmed few plugins for hey0 mod to improve my MC experience. Later on, I found a game called <a href='http://colobot.info'>Colobot</a>, which I completed and my programming skills improved greatly.<BR><BR></p>

<p>I decided to split up this page into categories which can be found in menu above. Yeah, every of these categories describes something different so you better give a shot to all of them ;)</p>
