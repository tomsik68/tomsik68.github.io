title: About Me
---
Hello World! My name is Tomsik68. I'm 18 year-old boy who is interested in video games, programming, sci-fi and stuff.
My IRL name is Tomas Jasek and I live in Slovakia. 

I spend most of my time at PC by programming. My favourite programming languages are Java &amp; Python and C with C++ are slowly getting on the fav list :), but I also know VB.NET, C# and I'm learning Pascal at school. You can find some of my projects open-sourced on github(link is below in contact section) and also this page. I started programming when I was 11. 
It was time when I received my first Nintendo DS console. I wanted to create games really really much, so I picked up C. It was lots of pain, but I was very happy that I could get something to show on both screens :))
Then, I created some _"demo-half-done-games"_ in Game Editor, which I really liked for making games... After some time of no-programming, I purchased MineCraft.
I wanted a 'creative' mode which wasn't available at that time(alpha 1.1.2), so I programmed few plugins for hey0 mod to improve my MC experience and also learned java basics. Later on, I found a game called <a href='http://colobot.info'>Colobot</a>, which I completed and my programming skills improved greatly. After completing Colobot, there was a huge gap in my life as I had nothing to do in free time, so I went back to minecraft. I'm currently maintaining several plugins for Bukkit platform, which are open-sourced on github. These plugins are updated like two or three times per year during vacations, but I still enjoy working on them and providing support. 

Apart from MC plugins, I like game development. I occasionally participate a Ludum Dare competetition(I did themes "Evolution" and "10 seconds"). My game making passion is made stronger by my friend @dudoslav, who is more passionate about C++. We're working together on a few projects, including open-source game template/library called quark, tunneler remake, lunch system for our school and many more. <-- this is where we currently are, there's really nothing more to write. Wait for things to happen and then come back :)  <BR><BR>

I decided to split up this page into categories which can be found in menu above. Yeah, every of these categories describes something different so you better give a shot to all of them ;)
