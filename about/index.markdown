title: About Me

Hello World! My name is Tomsik68. I'm 18 year-old boy who is interested in video games, programming, sci-fi and stuff.
My IRL name is Tomas and I live in Slovakia. There's really nothing to say about my personal life, because there's none :)

Most of my time is spent by playing MineCraft, either vanilla or few modpacks from technic launcher. I prefer multiplayer, but I play singleplayer most of time, since my friends don't play MC so much. Next game I play really often is Spelunky, which I only play on XBOX.
_Sometimes_ I play some LoL (I'm on both EUNE and EUW, summoner name: "jaskuu"). I don't play it very often, because it gets boring over time &amp; it needs to patch very often.
		
My next gaming passions are old-school games. Not so much old-school, but today it's old-school already. I'm talking about several older free titles like Happy Land Adventures, which I played a lot as child, Icy tower, Chicken Invaders 1. I also love these old legendary strategies - Age of Empires 2 and StarCraft 1.
Last but not least, I like some DOS games. These are really funny and I could spend whole days playing these. I'm talking about Hocus Pocus(which I completed), Crystal Caves 1,2 and 3, Prehistorik 1,2, Dangerous Dave, Tunneler and Prince of Persia.<BR>
I also mentioned I like programming, so here it goes... My favourite programming languages are Java &amp; Python and C with C++ are slowly getting on the fav list :), but I also know VB.NET, C# and I'm learning Pascal at school. You can find some of my projects open-sourced on github(link is below in contact section) and also this page. I started programming when I was 11. 
It was time when I received my first Nintendo DS console. I wanted to create games really really much, so I picked up C. It was lots of pain, but I was very happy that I could get something to show on both screens :))
Then, I created some _"demo-half-done-games"_ in Game Editor, which I really liked for making games... After some time of no-programming, I purchased MineCraft.
I wanted a 'creative' mode which wasn't available at that time(alpha 1.1.2), so I programmed few plugins for hey0 mod to improve my MC experience and also learned java basics. Later on, I found a game called <a href='http://colobot.info'>Colobot</a>, which I completed and my programming skills improved greatly.<BR><BR>

I decided to split up this page into categories which can be found in menu above. Yeah, every of these categories describes something different so you better give a shot to all of them ;)
