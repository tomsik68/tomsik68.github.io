## Me & Minecraft
Minecraft has been my favourite game for a very long time. I was playing since Alpha 1.1.

I do a lot of Minecraft-related stuff and you can find everything on this page.

## Bukkit Plugins

I started with hey0 plugins, but hey0 mod is not available anymore, so I switched to Bukkit along with many others.
To learn more about my Bukkit Plugins, the best place to visit is my [BukkitDev profile](http://dev.bukkit.org/profiles/tomsik68).

## MCLauncher-API

MCLauncher-API is relatively new project. It allows you to create a Minecraft launcher really quickly. It consists of libraries that let you interact with Minecraft services really easily, so you only need to build GUI for the launcher.
MCLauncher-API's [source is hosted on Github](https://github.com/tomsik68/mclauncher-api) and has [its own website](http://tomsik68.github.io/mclauncher-api/) (WARNING: the page is white!)

## Other activities

Other than that, I enjoy playing Minecraft on multiplayer servers.
